#<h1 align="center">42KL Piscine Projects</h1>

This repo serves as my workings of 42 Piscine C projects. These projects were completed during a 4-week intensive program aimed at teaching the fundamentals of the C programming language. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of C programming, building upon the knowledge and skills gained in the previous projects.

## Rush Projects

The following is a list of the group projects (known as Rush Projects) completed during the 42 Piscine, in the order they were completed:

1. **Rush 00**: In this project, we created a program that generates a sequence of patterns in the form of a NxN grid.
2. **Rush 01**: In this project, we created a program that solves the skyscrapper quiz.

## Knowledge Accquired

Throughout the Piscine, we gained knowledge and skills in the following areas of C programming, in the following order:

1. **Data Types (Bytes)**: We learned about the different data types in C, including integers, floats, and characters, and how they are stored in memory as bytes.

2. **Pointers**: We learned about pointers, which allow us to manipulate the memory directly, and how to use them to pass variables by reference.

3. **String Manipulation**: We learned how to manipulate strings in C, including concatenation, copying, and searching.

4. **Sorting Algorithm**: We learned various sorting algorithm, including selection sort, bubble sort and insertion sort.

5. **Base Conversion**: We learned how to convert between different number bases, including decimal, hexadecimal, and binary bases.

6. **Command Line Arguments**: We learned how to pass arguments to a C program through the command line, and how to use them.

7. **Memory Allocation**: We learned about memory allocation in C, including dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and free dynamic memory using `free`.

8. **Recursion**: We learned about recursion, and how to use it to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems.

9. **Headers**: We learned about headers, and how to use them to organize our code and make it more modular.

10. **Makefile**: We learned how to use Makefiles to automate the building and compiling of our programs.

11. **Linked List**: We learned about linked lists, and how to use them to create dynamic data structures in C.
